Postmortem: DNS Configuration Error Leading to Service Disruptions
>>>>>>> 5d25ca34a1a0a969ea8313a9f55cd44401028afb
Issue Summary
Duration: The DNS outage occurred from February 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (EAT) to February 15, 2024, 2:30 PM (EAT).
  Impact: During the outage, users experienced DNS resolution failures, resulting in service disruptions across our web applications. Approximately 75% of users were affected.
Timeline
10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in failed DNS queries.
 10:15 AM: Incident escalated to the Network Operations Center (NOC) team.
  10:30 AM: Investigation began, focusing on DNS servers and configurations.
  11:00 AM: Assumed root cause: Misconfigured DNS records due to recent infrastructure changes.
  11:30 AM: Debugging path: Checked DNS zone files, verified records, and reviewed recent changes.
  12:00 PM: Escalated incident to the Systems Engineering team for further analysis.
  1:00 PM: Root cause confirmed: Incorrect TTL (Time-to-Live) values in DNS records causing caching issues.
   1:30 PM: Resolution: Updated TTL values to align with best practices.
   2:30 PM: DNS resolution stabilized, services restored.

Root Cause and Resolution
   Cause: The misconfigured TTL values led to excessive caching, resulting in outdated DNS records being served to clients.
    Resolution: We adjusted TTL values to shorter intervals (e.g., 5 minutes) to reduce caching duration. Additionally, we audited all DNS records for consistency.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
   Automated TTL Management: Implement automated scripts to adjust TTL values based on record type and importance.
  Regular Audits: Conduct quarterly DNS record audits to catch misconfigurations promptly.
    Monitoring Enhancements: Set up real-time alerts for abnormal DNS query patterns.
    Documentation Update: Document best practices for DNS configuration and record management.

The Great DNS Tango: A Comedy of Errors
Issue Summary
Duration: From February 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (EAT) to February 15, 2024, 2:30 PM (EAT).
  Impact: Picture this—our DNS servers decided to moonwalk off the stage, leaving users stranded in a digital desert. Approximately 75% of users were caught in the crossfire.

The Cha-Cha Timeline
    10:00 AM: Our monitoring alerts went berserk, screaming, “Houston, we have a DNS problem!” 🚨
    10:15 AM: The NOC team, fueled by coffee and panic, sprang into action.
    10:30 AM: We dove headfirst into DNS servers, armed with magnifying glasses and a sense of impending doom.
    11:00 AM: Our Sherlock hats were on. Assumption: Recent infrastructure changes tripped over their own shoelaces.
    11:30 AM: Debugging path: We peeked into DNS zone files, squinted at records, and followed breadcrumbs like digital Hansel and Gretel.
    12:00 PM: The Systems Engineering team joined the party. They brought more coffee and a dash of existential dread.
    
The Dramatic Reveal: Root Cause and Resolution
    Cause: Our TTLs (Time-to-Live) were rebels without a cause—too long, too clingy. They clung to outdated records like a bad ex.
   Resolution: We whipped those TTLs into shape, set them to shorter intervals (5 minutes), and sent them to DNS therapy. They’re now well-adjusted and ready for commitment.

Encore, Encore! Corrective and Preventative Measures
    Automated TTL Therapy: Scripts to manage TTLs—because even TTLs need counseling.
    Quarterly DNS Dance-Off: Regular audits to catch missteps before they break into the cha-cha.
    Fancy Footwork Monitoring: Real-time alerts for DNS shenanigans.
    DNS Documentation Remix: Clear guidelines for DNS record management—no more freestyle.
